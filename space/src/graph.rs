//! Graph implementation with support for both directed and undirected graphs.
//!
//! This module provides a flexible graph data structure that can represent both directed
//! and undirected graphs through a type parameter. The implementation supports basic
//! set operations and is designed to work with the topology traits defined in the
//! definitions module.
